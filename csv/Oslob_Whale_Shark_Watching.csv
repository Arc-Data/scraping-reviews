jovy cleofe,5 stars,a year ago,Enjoyed this encounter with the whale sharks. Our group saw 3 whale sharks when we visited this place in July 2022. Lots of local and foreign tourists were here! You can actually swim with the whale sharks as the whale sharks are fed so that the tourists can see them up close.
