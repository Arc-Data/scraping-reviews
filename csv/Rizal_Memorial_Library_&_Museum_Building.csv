Joyce Mae Mulo,3 stars,5 months ago,"The place is nice, but it lacks charging area. Water bottles aren't allowed and that makes it more annoying because if you want to drink water, you need to go back to the baggage area to get some water. But overall it's nice and cold so you might want to bring jacket or so. For now, I'll rate it 3 stars."
Ron Joel Bernel,5 stars,4 months ago,"Definitely a good place to study, especially those who are preparing for the board exams. Bring your jackets 'cos it really gets cold inside."
Moses Mari Lacierda,5 stars,a year ago,Lovely American-Era architecture. The Library is just below the Cebu Provincial Museum. It is a very good place to read books about the history of Cebu and the Visayas in general. A must-see is their collection of Filipiniana books. Lovely. And it is fully airconditioned too.

Ruby Salutan,2 stars,5 years ago,"Newly refurbished grand hall. A very historical place.  Very nice classical look, with ballroom that has a capacity of maybe about 300 pax.
