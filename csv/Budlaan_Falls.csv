Khyrhys Gonzalez,1 star,10 months ago,I would NOT recommend this place. The guides will slap you with a price and the falls isn‚Äôt event worth the experience. THIS IS THE WORST HIKE we‚Äôve ever been. 500 for a 30min walk? Ridiculous. We just payed because we were worried they might do something to our car.
AJ Carag,4 stars,10 months ago,It's a short hike (about 30-45 minutes one way). It's quite tough since there are no signs & railings. You need a guide to go there). It's within Cebu city
