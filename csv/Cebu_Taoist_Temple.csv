Drew Cañizares,4 stars,4 years ago,This offers an overlooking view of the city of Cebu and its nearby places. It can get so simmering hot by summer here when it's not used to be 10 years ago. The temple is supposed to be sacred and quiet but be aware of some tourists again who cannot remain tacit during the visit.

And a place is located on top of the hill. So you might have to walk for a while unless you take a taxi up there. If you visit Cebu, do not this place."

Atty. Lau Porta,5 stars,4 years ago,"The place is open at 8 AM and closes at 6 PM. It's located inside the posh Beverly Hills. You can enter it by surrendering an ID at the guard. The place ia typically a place of worship for Taoist. Sometimes guides will be there to teach you how they light candles, make wishes and pray to the Gods."

Enriquez Jonathan Galvan,5 stars,4 years ago,A must place to visit. But if you hate climbig stairs this place is not for you. Great place to take some photos but they dont allow taking pictures inside n the temple.  It also gives a breath taking view of the city once you reached the top.
