vaun stanton,5 stars,9 months ago,"If you like history, you will like going here. Built by the Spanish in 1565.  Marvel at the heavy wooden doors, thick stone walls and numerous cannons positioned for defence. Paintings of the famous Lapu Lapu battle. Easy to spend an hour or more taking everything in."

Rich Leung,3 stars,9 months ago,Not expensive to get in but nothing really there to warrant an entry fee other than grounds keeping. The fort is very well kept with many places for photo taking opportunity. I agree with their additional charges for photo shooting but likely for the fort closure in such a case. A nice way to spend the afternoon
