Rainbow Journal,4 stars,5 years ago,One of the beautiful buildings that frames the park.
Karen Tagalog (izmekaren),4 stars,5 years ago,The building has an old unique look externally. I personally love the floors especially the stairs. It is a large building and it even has a public library on the third floor. It's commonly used by students who are reviewing for board examination and for students who has research and thesis.

Ching Pangilinan,4 stars,6 years ago,"The building in itself is a work of art by Filipino pioneering architect Juan Arellano built in 1941, but the BPI Cebu Museum doesn't accommodate walk in requests so it is best to arrange for a tour in advance."
