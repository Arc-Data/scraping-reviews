Tiffany Garcia,3 stars,4 years ago,"The place was cool. It's just, the service in their cafe is awfully slow, you will have to wait for almost an hour to have your order served. But for the record, their food and beverages taste really good. Although I'm still not sure if it's enough to say that the wait is worth it."

Sociallyconz Space (Sociallyconz),3 stars,5 years ago,The coffee shop is open. I like their coffee and there's net connection. Love it!  Sirao might have more perks because it has more view and statues but I was really searching for a place to unwind. If you're just going here for photos I think you would be dismayed though.
