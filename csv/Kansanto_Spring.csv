Rax Andre Co,5 stars,10 months ago,If you need a cool dip to freshen up from a hot summer day then this is one of your best place to visit.  The place is very relaxing and the spring water is ice cold.  You will definitely get a cool down if you take a dip.  Nice place for a small gathering of friends and family.
