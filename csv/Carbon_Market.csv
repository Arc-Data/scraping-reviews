Amor Amores,5 stars,3 weeks ago,I love the place. It has a lot of food and drinks options. Better be early because Saturday and Sunday is a busy day. Around 6:30 pm there were a lot of people eating and tables were all occupied and ventilation inside was not good so it was hot. There's also a band singing so it was good. All in all it was good to try Filipino food.
the bre,4 stars,3 weeks ago,"If you are looking for goods with cheaper-than-mall prices, here is the best place to go shopping. You will be buying from direct suppliers thus the low pricing. Fresh fish, meat, veggies and spices are all for half the usual cost. Cons: overcrowded and not for the ""maselan"" due to the environment."
