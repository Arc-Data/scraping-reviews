Sean Edgley,3 stars,4 years ago,"As of July 2019, you still can't climb up. A sign states that it's government property and well, it's functioning as an active lighthouse, off-limits to the public. So you can stand on the lower concrete slab and have a decent view of the ocean and part of a beach. Otherwise, you can't have much of a view here unless you have a drone."
