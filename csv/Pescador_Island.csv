Ronald Hofstee,5 stars,a month ago,An amazing dive spot! Crystal clear water and the corals are in good health and color. At the south side there are lots of colorful fish! Very nice to see is the Cathedral cave. For sure you will see the frog fish and with a little luck you will see the white tip shark.
Rocky Ping,5 stars,3 months ago,"Sardines and turtles are amazing. The tourist is professional, they not only monitor carefully to ensure safety but also help us take best photos and records. Unforgettable moments!"
