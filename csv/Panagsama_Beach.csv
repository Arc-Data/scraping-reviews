Precious Agnes Bate,5 stars,3 months ago,"Highly recommended, with an affordable price for snorkeling, you can enjoy viewing sardines run and sea turtles."
T,5 stars,3 months ago,"Swim maybe 30 meters out in the sea and you can see thousands of sardines. If you are lucky there are also turtles. For a beach to tan and relax go to white beach, this is more to swim. Many shops/restaurants around as well"
Vadim Pavlov,4 stars,4 months ago,"There are a lot of sardines, but there is no beach as such, no changing rooms either. Turtles were not seen. The water is cloudy, there are algae and debris. Definitely not the coolest beach in the Philippines. By the way, the geotag is incorrec …"

Diana H,2 stars,5 months ago,"It is ok - seeing sardines and turtles were really cool - but this spot is far too touristy and the guides and tourists don't respect the site. It was sad coming here. Please do not touch, grab or stand on the coral !! It kills the coral - …"

Martin B,1 star,6 months ago,"Overrun by tourist, who ruin the experience. Both the guides and the tourist (most in life vests, as most do not know how to swim) have horrible underwater behaviour, harassing the animals and ruining the corals."

Petra,1 star,7 months ago,"I would give zero star if possible.

I was so sad to see that 95% of the corals are fully dead and mainly because of …"
McRey Banderlipe II,5 stars,7 months ago,The place in Moalboal with so many beautiful dive sites. I hope that they recover very soon after the typhoon so that I can appreciate their beauty more on my future dives.
Maria Sims,1 star,7 months ago,"There's no actual beach, the place looks horrible. People go only to snorkel/dive."
Matthew Birch,3 stars,7 months ago,"Sardines and snorkeling is good. Plenty of options for decent food and cheap cocktails.  Unfortunately I got glassed in the face, beaten up by two Filipinos and threatened with a machete in the main street at night. Be careful here"

Fedor Sparrow,5 stars,8 months ago,"This point will take you nowhere. Just go straight ahead. You will see the parking of bikes in front of the T-shaped intersection on the left and boldly park. Then we went on foot to the right. Walk 100 meters, and then on the left you …"
JC Carl,5 stars,9 months ago,Great dive spot and beginner friendly. Tour guide is a bit pricey but it's all worth it. You can dive for free but safety should be kept in mind. Wear rashguard or wet suit because there are a lot of planktons here. Sea turtles and corals …

Dhan Hermoso,5 stars,a year ago,"Surreal experience to swim with the sardines and sea green turtle.

Our jump off point is at Hungry Monkeys which is quite convenient to Sardines and if you are lucky enough you get to swim with sea green turtle/s."
