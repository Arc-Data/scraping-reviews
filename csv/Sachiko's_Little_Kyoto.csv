Francis Ray Escuadro,5 stars,2 years ago,"Just a little dissatisfied about the way they want is to pay the food. We will pay first in the Entrance and then getting back at every kiosk to get the food. Hope they will re organized it in the future, but for now i'll gave it a 5 star because i'm amazed of the view and the place is great to unwind and fell the presence of nature."

Kira Collins,1 star,2 years ago,Food service is terrible. We were not inform that we will pay our order near the entrance. We don't mind waiting but we were not inform in advance so we have to go down and up. No exact communication from the booth once our food was ready ‚Ä¶
