Lyra P√©rez Dumdum,5 stars,a month ago,We've been family friends with the Jumalons for forever so going to thus place is required. It's a great place to learn about biodiversity. The City really needs to preserve and fund places like these.

Staff were so knowledgable and friendly. Really enjoyed our time there and was very interesting to hear about the butterflies and see the art."
Gordon Bollig,4 stars,2 months ago,"It is a collection of an artist‚Äôs collection 100s of butterfly species from around the world, and personal art. Had a garden but due to it being open air not many live butterflies when I went. Highlights was the mosaics made with dead butterfly wings. Place is a little out of its prime but shouldn‚Äôt stop anyone from goin."

"DELA PE√ëA, ALTHEA B.",5 stars,4 months ago,The place has a long and rich history. I wholeheartedly advise everyone interested in learning anything about butterflies to visit this location. There is a ton of trivia and myths you can discover about these species. The location is also spotless and quite relaxing. Make sure you won't be leaving any garbages behind when you arrive.
